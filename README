This tool will take a collection of postings from the "centos-announce" mailing
list. It can accept a digest, a decompressed pipermail archive downloaded from
the list archive pages[1] or use the Mail Archive site, convert the postings to
basic errata, upload them to a spacewalk server and publish them to a named
channel which contains the relevant update packages.
